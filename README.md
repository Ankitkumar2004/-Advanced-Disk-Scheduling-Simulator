# -Advanced-Disk-Scheduling-Simulator
This project aims to develop a disk scheduling simulator to visualize and compare the performance of different disk scheduling algorithms, including:
•	First Come First Serve (FCFS)
•	Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
•	SCAN
•	C-SCAN
The simulator will allow users to input custom disk access requests and observe how the algorithms minimize seek time. Users will also be able to view performance metrics like average seek time and system throughput.
