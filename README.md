# -Advanced-Disk-Scheduling-Simulator
Build a disk scheduling simulator to visualize algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN. Users should be able to input custom disk access requests and see how the algorithms minimize seek time. Include performance metrics like average seek time and system throughput.
